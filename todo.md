# Graphics

- when all sections are folded, the rest of the page should have a black
  background, with the QED â–¡ ending the thread equally spaced from the spoil
  buttons
- use pacmans instead of arrows for spoil buttons
- Small lines to mark h2 titles
- Custom bullet lists integrated in the thread

# Layout

# Interaction

- restrict header summary to lzone
- make rzone (including triangle) into a clickable link to blog page

# Animation

- linearly animated color inversion on click on rzone (ideally should also
  invert GitHub logo)
