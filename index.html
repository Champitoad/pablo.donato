          Hi! Welcome to my webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a 3ʳᵈ year PhD student in computer science, working within the Partout
          team of the LIX laboratory under the supervision of Benjamin Werner.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work lies at the intersection between mathematical logic and
          human-computer interaction, with applications to interactive theorem
          proving. More precisely, I try to design graphical representations of
          mathematical theories that are better suited to direct manipulation by
          humans, but still understandable by computers.
        </p>

        <h2>PhD thesis</h2>
    
        <p>
          I develop three interrelated lines of investigations:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Proof-by-action</strong> is a paradigm where the user
              builds proofs by executing gestural actions directly on the proof
              state. Typically, this corresponds to the possibility of clicking,
              dragging and dropping items which represent the conclusion and
              hypotheses of the current goal. A prototype implementation of this
              paradigm called Actema is already available online at <a
              href="http://actema.xyz">actema.xyz</a>. With Benjamin Werner, we are
              currently building coq-actema, a system that extends and
              integrates the interface of Actema in the Coq proof assistant.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Deep inference</strong> is a new methodology in proof theory, which aims
              at overcoming some limitations of Gentzen-style proof systems while
              preserving their good properties. In the setting of interactive proof
              building, one interesting feature of deep inference systems is their
              ability to preserve the context in which reasoning is performed. This
              gave rise recently to the idea of subformula linking, a method for
              solving goals incrementally by connecting dual occurrences of
              subformulas. I designed an extension of subformula linking for
              intuitionistic first-order logic with equality, which generalizes the
              behavior of known application and rewriting tactics.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Existential graphs</strong> are among the first diagrammatic proof
              systems in history, invented by C. S. Peirce as early as 1882. They
              enable a kind of reasoning free from the linguistic notion of logical
              connective, which is a promising venue for fully graphical proving
              interfaces. Initially conceived for classical logic, A. Oostra
              recently introduced an intuitionistic version of existential graphs,
              based on Peirce's own intuitions of logical implication. This paves
              the way for connections with the trend of constructive logics in proof
              assistants.
            </p>
            <p>
              To handle quantification and equality, Peirce and Oostra use so-called lines of
              identity, a string diagram-like notation well-suited to the intensional analysis
              of relations. But state-of-the-art proof assistants are based on type theory —
              and thus at their core on the λ-calculus, which is an intensional theory of
              functions. Hence I designed a fully inductive variant of Oostra's graphs, based
              on the standard notions of binder and variable at the root of λ-calculus. This
              eases the development of a formalized metatheory, as well as the connection with
              type theory. I named it flower calculus, because of the way I like to draw the
              graphs as nested flowers.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Since the day I discovered computers, I have been fascinated by their
          ability to represent and give life to human intentions. I quickly got into
          programming to unlock their full creative potential, but always felt a
          discrepancy between the immediacy and intuitiveness of graphical interfaces,
          and the expressivity and rigidity of programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I discovered formal logic, a field that claims to capture correct reasoning
          and truth instead of arbitrary computation. This really hit home, as the
          experience of program debugging deepened my doubts about the meaningfulness of
          my own thoughts. How could I ever be sure the programs I wrote would always
          behave in the way I intended them to? Formal logic provided a language to
          clarify my intent, and guarantee that programs respect it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now although I love analysing things under the logico-computational microscope,
          I feel like it focuses too much on linguistic expressions, and the way they can
          be classified and checked for validity. It assumes I already know what I want,
          and how to express it symbolically. What I seek for is a format enabling a true
          collaboration with the computer, one where I can freely visualize, manipulate,
          transform and discover new ideas under its guidance, instead of squeezing my
          thoughts in its pre-existing categories. Meaning should emerge from my
          interaction with the computer and its users, not from my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I believe that logic can offer principled ways of designing and evolving
          such formats. This is because logicians have developed conceptual tools to
          specify meaning a priori, before knowing its precise embodiment.  But to make
          this reality possible, we need to rethink the architecture of the logical
          edifice, so that we can articulate formats in a less rigid, more interoperable
          way. We need to open logic to the world, rather than try to fit the world into
          logics.
